Repo for BIOS 784 Computational Biology Project (Bladder Cancer)

Looking at GSE1827 (all subjects have cancer)

Intro: 
-Background
-Show the clustering diagram of the 80 tumors into superficial/invasive clusters and describe
-Re-create this cluster diagram

Goal #0 (Recreate from Paper)
-Do clustering on the whole thing (exploratory analysis)

Goal #1 (Gene Set selections)
-Examine difference between invasive and superficial tumors using our methods from class (lmfit)
    -> find set of genes predictive of this outcome (not controlling for anything)
-Use multiple p-value cutoffs (.001, .0001) and compare the results
-Use different sample sizes


Goal #2 (Predictions)
-Using gene sets from #1, use different methods and cross validation sizes to predict



Steps forward from Nov 8:
-Each work with/play around with goals 1 and 2
-At next meet work on comparing different gene sets we get for #1
      - Also compare different methods
