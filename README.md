Looking at GSE1827 (all subjects have cancer)

Intro: 
-Background
-Show the clustering diagram of the 80 tumors into superficial/invasive clusters and describe
-Re-create this cluster diagram

Goal #1
-Examine difference between invasive and superficial tumors using our methods from class (lmfit)
    -> find set of genes predictive of this outcome (not controlling for anything)
-Use multiple p-value cutoffs (.001, .0001) and compare the results

Goal #2
-Stratify by gender, look for overlaps (exploratory analysis)

Goal #3
-Do clustering on the whole thing (exploratory analysis)

Goal #4
-Look at (possibly) Annotation Hub to explore functions of genes that we identified in Goal #1 with our limma method
