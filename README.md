Repo for BIOS 784 Computational Biology Project (Bladder Cancer)

Looking at GSE1827 (all subjects have cancer)

Goal #1
-Examine difference between invasive and superficial tumors using our methods from class
    -> find set of genes predictive of this outcome, controlling for gender (possibly other characteristics)
-Compare what we get to what they got in the paper

Goal #2
-Stratify by gender, look for overlaps (exploratory analysis)

Goal #3
-Do clustering on the whole thing (exploratory analysis)

Goal #4
-Look at (possibly) Annotation Hub to explore functions of genes that we identified in Goal #1 with our limma method
